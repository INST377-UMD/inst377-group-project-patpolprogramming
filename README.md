Description: < Welcome to our COVID-19 Tracker. For this project, we 
            decided to create an interface that allows users to search through data 
            regarding COVID-19. The interface would then be able to search through an 
            API and return results relating to the spread of COVID through communities. 
            The results of the search vary from which regions were affected to 
            calculating the number of infected individuals. Our proposed systems would 
            solve the information problem by providing an intuitive interface for users 
            to search data regarding the spread of COVID-19. Easily-sourced and readily 
            available data regarding COVID-19 might be currently difficult to encounter 
            for the common user. Our system would allow that data to be compiled and 
            easily accessible through consulting an API and building a user interface that is comfortable for most users. The API provides users with data ranging from historic US COVID-19 values, single day values, individual state/territory values, and more. For this project, 
            we have extracted data from this API in order to give users information 
            regarding the spread of the virus in specific locations across the US. >
Target Browsers: < We aim to further develop our application for iOS browsers and possibly branch out onto android devices. We currently have the application developed for common web  browsers such as google, firefox, edge, etc.>
